Architectures : 
1. U-Net:

A convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation. U-Net uses an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections to capture both local and global context.

2.TernausNet:

TernausNet is a U-Net variant that utilizes a pre-trained VGG11 encoder, which helps the model learn more discriminative features for segmentation. It is known for faster convergence and strong performance.

3. U-Net++:

U-Net++ refines the U-Net by introducing densely connected convolutional layers between the encoder and decoder, improving the precision of segmentation, especially on complex medical images.
